<div class="the">The Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut is a hypercar made by the Swedish company Koenigsegg. It is designed to be the fastest car ever produced by Koenigsegg and is considered the third fastest car in the world.</div>

<div class="top">üîπ Top Speed:

The Jesko Absolut is expected to reach around 330 mph (531 km/h).

This speed has not been fully verified in official public tests yet, but Koenigsegg engineers are confident it can achieve it.</div>

<div class="eng">üîπ Engine & Power:

Powered by a 5.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine.

Produces up to 1,600 horsepower when using E85 fuel.

  9-speed automatic transmission designed by Koenigsegg.</div>


<div class="des">üîπ Design & Aerodynamics:

The Jesko Absolut has an extremely smooth and aerodynamic body.

Unlike the standard Jesko (which is focused on track racing with a big rear wing), the Absolut version has no large wing.

  This helps to reduce drag and makes the car faster on long straight roads.</div>

<div class="spe">üîπ Special Features:

Built almost entirely from lightweight carbon fiber.

Advanced active aerodynamics and rear-wheel steering for stability.

  Limited production, very rare and very expensive (around $3 million).</div>
